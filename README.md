# IoTOntology

IoT ontology developed by Darko Andročec in IoTIF project

This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project IP-2014-09-3877.

The representation of IoT devices and things as a services is determined as the domain of the ontology. This ontology will be used to semantically annotate things as a service. The information in the ontology should provide answers to the following questions: What are the concepts to describe IoT devices and things as a services? How to support mappings of data types among the heterogeneous things and existing cloud services?
